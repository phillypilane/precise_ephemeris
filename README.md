# precise ephemeris calculation

The Broadcast ephemeris file is used to predict a satellites position for four hours, given a precise initial position (x, y and z) of that satellite for a particular epoch. The predicted orbit of the satellite becomes grossly erroneous for predictions further than four hours. Fortunately, the satellite is able to send a navigation message every time it is observed, typically 12 to 13 navigation messages are broadcasted and those messages can be decoded to predict position of a satellite using all epochs to have predictions for a whole day. The precise ephemeris (in the form of a .sp3 file) is a file containing the best solution of all satellites position (x, y and z) every 15 minutes (every 900 seconds) of the day.

This code decodes Kepler’s parameters, nine perturbation parameters and the reference epoch from the broadcast ephemeris file – these parameters will be used in accordance with the Broadcast Ephemeris Algorithm to compute (predict) the position of a satellite (as a radial vector from the geocentre) for every 900 seconds to compare them against the actual position of the satellite (as radial vector) extracted from the x, y and z coordinates in the .sp3 file (precise ephemeris file).
